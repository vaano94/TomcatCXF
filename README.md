# TomcatCXF
Tomcat as a transport in CXF

## Status

date: 03/04/2019
We learned about the CXF structure and finally found an integration test for the embedded Jetty implementation called [EngineLifecycleTest](https://github.com/gcorsini/cxf/blob/master/systests/transports/src/test/java/org/apache/cxf/systest/http_jetty/EngineLifecycleTest.java#L88).

date: 08/04/2019
We compared the Jetty and Undertow implementation and studied the tests in more details.

date:15/04/2019
We generated two class diagrams (of the existing Jetty and Undertow implementation) and a sequence diagram of the EngineLifecycleTest. We wrote short summaries of our findings. All of it can be found here https://github.com/vaano94/TomcatCXF/tree/master/documentation.
